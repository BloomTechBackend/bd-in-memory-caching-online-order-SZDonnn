The key/value structure for the `LoadingCache` object is defined in the declaration of `LoadingCache`. So it would look 
something like: `private static LoadingCache<K,V> someCache;` 

In this example, `K` is the data type of the key and `V` is the data type of the value and `someCache` is the name of the 
instance variable that stores our cache object.
